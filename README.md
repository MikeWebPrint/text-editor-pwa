  ## Description
  
  The purpose of this project was to take an existing online application and transform it into a PWA so that it could not only function offline in the browser, but also be able to be installed by the user as a standalone application.

  ## Credits
  
  This project did have starter code, as the text editor was existing. I modeled the PWA functionality on similar code in class projects.  I do wish to thank my instructor Kris Renaldi and the tutoring staff for assistance in troubleshooting the service worker implementation and deployment to Heroku, where this app is hosted.

  ## Features
  
  In addition to the basic functionality of a text editor, this app uses IndexedDB to hold data, with local storage as a fallback. It incorporates the use of Webpack as a build process, and is setup with an Express server on the back end.
